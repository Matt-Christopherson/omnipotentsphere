            <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
            <h3 class="date">May 1, 2025</h3>
            <p>Hello hello hello, my name is Matthew. Welcome to my <strong>OMNIPOTENT SPHERE</strong>! My girlfriend, <a
                href="https://whatdeweydo.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Megan</a>, recently got into Neocities and has finally
                convinced me to make my own site. I have some web development knowledge, but now I just do it as a hobby. This is
                my little pigsty where I plan to vomit out all my thoughts on the floor and see if anyone comes around to sniff
                it. I plan to talk about <strong>indie tabletop roleplaying games, films, politics</strong>, and anything else
                that I want to spit up.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>My experience with TTRPGs is mostly theoretical. I played D&D 5th edition pretty consistently for two years
                before becoming very burnt out on the game. I might make a post eventually about my thoughts on the game, and why
                I quit playing it, but it essentially boils down to this: <strong>the combat is boring and the game is all about
                    combat</strong>. So after realizing my own discontent with the game, I went seeking out other RPGs. I have
                amassed a hoard consisting of <strong>Call of Cthulhu</strong>, a plethora of systems in the <strong>OSR</strong>
                genre (Knave and Troika! being my favorites), a handful of <strong>Forged in the Dark</strong> games, and a
                splatter of random bullshit.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>I say my experience with TTRPGs is mostly theoretical, because, like the Learned Society of York Magicians, I
                primarily read about TTRPGs! I gobble up blog posts, YouTube reviews, and rulesets like a mad man trying to
                discover the fundamental truth of the universe. Tragically I have little use for all this knowledge crammed in my
                brain. With all my wisdom ranging from the dogmas of ye Olde School Renaissance to the philosophies of "Fiction
                First" nonsense, my only outlet for tabletop gaming is playing in a weekly (and now on hiatus) campaign of
                Pathfinder 2nd Edition. I think that's a big reason why I'm starting this blog. <strong>I need to shoot these
                    demons out of my forehead, get them on the page, and slam the book shut.</strong> This blog is an outlet!</p>

            <p>Politically, I identify as a socialist. Billionaires bad, workers good. <strong>Trans rights!</strong> And so on.
                I'm not the most well-spoken person when it comes to politics, so I wouldn't expect to see too many political
                posts. Thank god for that!</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>To give you a sense of my taste in film, I'm basically a diet film-bro. I love me my boring black and white
                french films, my Scorseses, my Tarantinos, and I hate Marvel films, but I try really hard not to be pretentious,
                and I don't really know anything about film. My four favorites on Letterboxd are <strong>Howl's Moving Castle,
                    Fargo, Alien, and After Hours</strong>. My favorite directors are Martin Scorsese, the Coen brothers, and Hayao
                Miyazaki.</p>
            <p>What about the miscellaneous stuff?? Well, I might occasionally talk about video games, TV, religion, or whatever
                I'm thinking about a lot. I'm not as into video games as I used to be, and I don't really have strong opinions on
                them anymore, but I still enjoy talking about them every now and then. My favorite games of all time are
                <strong>Breath of the Wild, Hollow Knight, Elden Ring, and Disco Elysium</strong>. I'm currently watching a lot of
                Droupout TV, and I was watching season 2 of the Last of Us, but it's been a bit of a let down so far. I hate the
                actress for Abby, and the writing in general feels very unnatural. Religiously I am agnostic (the boring opinion),
                but I like reminiscing on my LDS upbringing. I've been getting back into reading recently. I feel like I'm playing
                catch up for all the years that I put the hobby to the side. Right now my favorite author is <strong>Kurt
                    Vonnegut</strong>. Diving into the pulp fantasy roots of D&D has been interesting, I'd love to make a blog about
                my (iffy) feelings about the likes of Robert E. Howard, Fritz Leiber, and Jack Vance (yes the name of this site is
                a Jack Vance reference).
            </p>

            <p>There you go! Look at you, you weirdo. It's like you're reading a man's diary! I can't believe you read this
                whole post. Thanks for showing interest in my twisted evil mind. I don't expect anyone to follow this blog. Making
                this post is like yelling into a dark hole and feeling uneasy by the thought that someone might yell back. I don't
                know how to end this. Bye bye!</p>
